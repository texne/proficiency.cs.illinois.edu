<!--- -->
**CS proficiency exams are given at the start of Fall and Spring semesters.**
</p><p class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
The exams are held around the start of classes each fall and spring, with any in-person exams being held after dorms open.  Due to uncontrollable factors such as Covid-19 tending to change the university's move-in arrangements, we will wait until about a month before the start of each term to pin down details (e.g. dates, are any exams offered online).   At that point, we will update the information below so that it reflects the upcoming term.

If you have already mastered the material covered in certain Illinois Computer Science
courses, you may receive credit and satisfy prerequisites by taking a
*proficiency exam*.
<!--- -->
Here you will find details about how to prepare and sign up for Illinois CS
proficiency exams.
<!--- -->
</p>

## <a name="overview" class="anchor"></a> Overview

Proficiency exams are similar in coverage and scope to a comprehensive
final exam.
<!--- -->
They are intended to ensure that you are well-prepared for later courses in the
same subject area.   So we expect performance at the B- level or above.
<!--- -->
**Specific passing criteria are at the discretion of each course instructor.**
<!--- -->

**For the core programming sequence (CS 124, CS 128, CS 225) you must attempt
the proficiency exams in order.**
Results are available immediately for the CS 124 and CS 128 exams, so you'll
know whether you can continue with the sequence.
We will not grant proficiency credit for exams taken out of sequence.

### <a name="scheduling" class="anchor"></a> Scheduling

Proficiency exams are offered at the beginning of each semester, and at other
times at the discretion of the department.

### <a name="next" class="anchor"></a> Next Proficiency Exam Dates and Times

<!-- -->
As we get closer to the exam dates, more details will be added under the individual courses below.   It's likely that some exams will be given online (e.g. with zoom proctoring) and some in-person.


**Note that CS proficiency exams are no longer using the online CBTF.**
<!-- -->
So there is nothing to sign up for on the CBTF website.


Note that most proficiency exams are three hours in length.   **You must arrive on time to take a proficiency exam.**

### <a name="restrictions" class="anchor"></a> General Restrictions

In certain cases you may not be eligible to take a proficiency exam.
<!--- -->
You are responsible for understanding these conditions.
<!--- -->
**We will not attempt to determine whether you are eligible to take a
proficiency exam before you take it.**
<!--- -->
You will only find out later that you will not receive credit.
<!--- -->
So please review these restrictions carefully.

1. **You may not take a proficiency exam for a course that you have already
received a grade for.**
<!--- -->
This is true even if it was a failing grade.
<!--- -->
1. **You may only take each proficiency exam once in a 12-month period.**
<!--- -->
So, once you take a proficiency exam, you must wait a full year to retake the
same exam.
<!--- -->
If you attempt the same exam before the year is up, your score will not be counted.
<!--- -->
This restriction applies regardless of how the proficiency exam is given.
<!--- -->
1. **You may not receive proficiency credit for a course if you have taken a
course in the same area.**
<!--- -->
For example, you may not receive proficiency credit for CS 173 if you have already
taken CS 374, since it is in the same area as CS 173.
<!--- -->
As another example, you may not receive proficiency credit for CS 124 if you
have already taken CS 128, for the same reason.
<!--- -->
Instead of taking the proficiency exam, you may be required to substitute other
later courses to fulfill your degree requirements.
<!--- -->
1. **Graduate students generally may only take Illinois Computer Science proficiency exams when
required to satisfy another degree program on our campus.**
<!--- -->
Please have your advisor contact the CS academic office to obtain permission if needed.

Other course-specific restrictions may also apply.
<!--- -->
Please consult the [information below specific to the proficiency exams you plan
to take](#courses) for more details.

### <a name="taking" class="anchor"></a> Taking Your Proficiency Exam

To take a Zoom-proctored proficiency exam first sign up if your exam requires
it (see specific course information below), then join the posted zoom
session at
one of the scheduled exam times.
<!---
To take a computer-based proficiency exam you must schedule a time with the
[CBTF](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/).
-->
<!--- -->
You must bring your University of Illinois ID to the proficiency exam, if you
have one.
<!--- -->
**If you show up late or without proper identification, you will not be able to
complete the exam.**

<!--
You may attempt multiple different proficiency exams during one written exam
sitting.

However, each exam period finishes promptly at the times [indicated
above](#next), so you will need to work quickly to complete multiple exams in
the time allotted.
-->

**CS proficiency exams are using Zoom proctoring but not the online CBTF.**
<!--- -->
However, you should still review the online CBTF instructions for how to set up
your environment to enable Zoom proctoring.
<!--- -->
Review [this
overview](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/paste/gxtm38rc1kx1l1/63f0a107df4734a1a567e4dce8feac5ae56052402202b8a91b10375ff48b9865/Student_Instructions.pdf)
and [these instructions for phone
positioning](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/paste/gxtm38rc1kx1l1/3ce9074b49070335c40d2c0d1365c7edcb39debd5a37755654f7337a62ffc289/How_to_Position_Your_Phone.pdf).
<!--- -->
You will need Zoom installed on your phone and configured to use your Illinois
account.

### <a name="results" class="anchor"></a> Receiving Your Results

For the CS 124 and 128 exams are entirely autograded, so
you will find out immediately whether you passed.   Some of
the other exams include some manually-graded questions,
so it may take several days before your exam is graded.  In
that case,
you will receive your proficiency exam results directly from the instructor
supervising the exam.
<!--- -->

Proficiency results are pass/no-pass only.    You will not receive detailed feedback.

It may take several weeks for proficiency credit to appear on your official transcript.
However, results are transmitted very quickly to the CS academic office so that we can
issue appropriate overrides for updating your registration.

### <a name="disabilities" class="anchor"></a> Information for Students with Disabilities

We will accommodate any disabilities that have been registered with the [Division
of Disability Resources and Educational Services
(DRES)](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/).
<!--- -->
Please register with DRES
to notify them of your disability and get an official letter documenting the accommodations
you require.
<!--- -->
**If you are new to the University of Illinois you should begin this process as
soon as you are admitted.**

If you qualify for testing-related accommodations, please review the
information below for the specific proficiency exams that you plan on taking.
<!--- -->
Instructions should be provided for how to communicate your accommodation
request.
<!--- -->
Please bring your letter of accommodation to your exam.
<!---
Many exams are using the CBTF online proctoring, in which case you should send
your letter of accommodation to [Carleen Sacris](mailto:sacris1@illinois.edu).
-->


Please make these arrangements _before_ your exam begins.    In particular, for an extended-time 
exam, you will need to know whether you are expected to arrive early or stay late.

<!---
You should make arrangements to take your proficiency exam in the DRES testing
center by contacting
<!---
[<code>proficiency&#8209;exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu</code>](mailto:proficiency-exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu).
<!---
In your email be sure to indicate which proficiency exam (or exams) you wish to
take, and include a copy of your DRES letter documenting your accommodations.
-->

### <a name="questions" class="anchor"></a> Questions or Concerns

If you have questions not covered here, or on the course-specific pages below,
please send email to the proficiency coordinators
at [proficiency-exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu](mailto:proficiency-exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu).
<!--- -->
That is the best way to have your questions answered quickly.
