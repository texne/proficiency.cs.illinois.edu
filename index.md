title: Illinois CS Proficiency Exams

<p class="lead" markdown="1">
<!--- -->
If you have already mastered the material covered in certain Illinois Computer Science
courses, you may receive credit and satisfy prerequisites by taking a
*proficiency exam*.
</p>

<!--- -->
<p class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
<!--- -->
**CS proficiency exams are given at the start of Fall and Spring semesters.**
</p>

  * Fall proficiency exams are held during freshman orientation week.
  
   * Spring proficiency exams are held the week before classes start in January.   
  
   * In both fall and spring, there are also additional dates during the first week of classes.

<!--- -->
It is best to take each exam at the earliest date that works for you, so that you can easily rework your class schedule and get caught up if you pass the exam.    The exams for the three core programming courses (CS 124, CS 128, CS 225) must be taken in order.  The first two exams (CS 124 and CS 128) are autograded, so you will know immediately whether you have passed and should consider attempting the next exam in the sequence.

Detailed information about each exam (e.g. dates) is typically posted several weeks before the start of each term.   Sign-up details usually appear a week or two before the first exam date.   Watch this page for the latest information.

## <a name="overview" class="anchor"></a> Exam format

Proficiency exams are similar in coverage and scope to a comprehensive
final exam.   They are two or three hours long, depending on the course.
<!--- -->
They are intended to ensure that you are well-prepared for later courses in the
same subject area.   So we expect performance at the B- level or above.
<!--- -->
**Specific passing criteria are at the discretion of each course instructor.**
<!--- -->

 **You must arrive on time to take a proficiency exam.**

 ### <a name="taking" class="anchor"></a> Taking Your Proficiency Exam

To take a Zoom-proctored proficiency exam first sign up if your exam requires
it (see specific course information below), then join the posted zoom
session at
one of the scheduled exam times.
<!---
To take a computer-based proficiency exam you must schedule a time with the
[CBTF](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/).
-->
<!--- -->
You must bring your University of Illinois ID to the proficiency exam, if you
have one.
<!--- -->
**If you show up late or without proper identification, you will not be able to
complete the exam.**




### <a name="results" class="anchor"></a> Receiving Your Results

For the CS 124 and 128 exams are entirely autograded, so
you will find out immediately whether you passed.   Some of
the other exams include some manually-graded questions,
so it may take several days before your exam is graded.  In
that case,
you will receive your proficiency exam results directly from the instructor
supervising the exam.
<!--- -->

Proficiency results are pass/no-pass only.    You will not receive detailed feedback.

It may take several weeks for proficiency credit to appear on your official transcript.
However, results are transmitted very quickly to the CS academic office so that we can
issue appropriate overrides for updating your registration.

### <a name="disabilities" class="anchor"></a> Information for Students with Disabilities

We will accommodate any disabilities that have been registered with the [Division
of Disability Resources and Educational Services
(DRES)](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/).
<!--- -->
Please register with DRES
to notify them of your disability and get an official letter documenting the accommodations
you require.
<!--- -->
**If you are new to the University of Illinois you should begin this process as
soon as you are admitted.**

If you qualify for testing-related accommodations, please review the
information below for the specific proficiency exams that you plan on taking.
<!--- -->
Instructions should be provided for how to communicate your accommodation
request.
<!--- -->
Please bring your letter of accommodation to your exam.
<!---
Many exams are using the CBTF online proctoring, in which case you should send
your letter of accommodation to [Carleen Sacris](mailto:sacris1@illinois.edu).
-->


Please make these arrangements _before_ your exam begins.    In particular, for an extended-time 
exam, you will need to know whether you are expected to arrive early or stay late.




### <a name="restrictions" class="anchor"></a> General Restrictions

In certain cases you may not be eligible to take a proficiency exam.
<!--- -->
You are responsible for understanding these conditions.
<!--- -->
**We will not attempt to determine whether you are eligible to take a
proficiency exam before you take it.**
<!--- -->
You will only find out later that you will not receive credit.
<!--- -->
So please review these restrictions carefully.

1. **You may not take a proficiency exam for a course that you have already
received a grade for.**
<!--- -->
This is true even if it was a failing grade.
<!--- -->
1. **You may only take each proficiency exam once in a 12-month period.**
<!--- -->
So, once you take a proficiency exam, you must wait a full year to retake the
same exam.
<!--- -->
If you attempt the same exam before the year is up, your score will not be counted.
<!--- -->
This restriction applies regardless of how the proficiency exam is given.
<!--- -->
1. **You may not receive proficiency credit for a course if you have taken a
course in the same area.**
<!--- -->
For example, you may not receive proficiency credit for CS 173 if you have already
taken CS 374, since it is in the same area as CS 173.
<!--- -->
As another example, you may not receive proficiency credit for CS 124 if you
have already taken CS 128, for the same reason.
<!--- -->
In this situation, you may be required to substitute other
later courses to fulfill your degree requirements.   Consult your departmental
advisor about whether to take the proficiency exam to verify your knowledge, even
though you can't get credit, and 
also to find out what substitute courses are appropriate.
<!--- -->
1. **Graduate students generally may only take Illinois Computer Science proficiency exams when
required to satisfy another degree program on our campus.**
<!--- -->
Please have your advisor contact the CS academic office to obtain permission if needed.

Other course-specific restrictions may also apply.
<!--- -->
Please consult the [information below specific to the proficiency exams you plan
to take](#courses) for more details.


### <a name="questions" class="anchor"></a> Questions or Concerns

If you have questions not covered here, or on the course-specific pages below,
please send email to the proficiency coordinators
at [proficiency-exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu](mailto:proficiency-exams@lists.cs.illinois.edu).
<!--- -->
That is the best way to have your questions answered quickly.
