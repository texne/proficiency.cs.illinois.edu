#### Additional information

The student code does not allow you to take the CS 173 Proficiency Exam after taking CS 374 (or a more advanced theoretical CS course).

The website for the Fall 2023 offering of CS 173 has a current set of skills lists, lecture notes, and videos. Course websites for Spring 2019 and earlier have old hardcopy exams that you can use for practice. (We have since moved the exams online.)

The exam will include some free-response questions (e.g. proofs) which are manually graded, so it will take a few days for results to be available.  Details will be posted here in August about how to enroll for the exam on Prairielearn and how to access a "Sandbox"  
assessment with notes on how to format your free-response work (LaTeX is not required).
