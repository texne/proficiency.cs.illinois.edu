#### Additional information

The student code does not allow you to take the CS 173 Proficiency Exam after taking CS 374 (or a more advanced theoretical CS course).

The website for the Fall 2023 offering of CS 173 has a current set of skills lists, lecture notes, and videos. Course websites for Spring 2019 and earlier have old hardcopy exams that you can use for practice. (We have since moved the exams online.)

The exam will include some free-response questions (e.g. proofs) which are manually graded, so it will take a few days for results to be available. Please enroll now in "CSPX 173: Proficiency Exam for CS 173 (Discrete Structures)" on PrairieLearn, and then check out the "Sandbox" assessment for notes on how to format your free-response work (LaTeX is not required). (Make sure you've also filled out the form above - enrolling in CSPX173 on PrairieLearn is *not* sufficient to sign up for the exam.)
