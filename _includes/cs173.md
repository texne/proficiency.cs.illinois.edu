#### Additional information

The student code does not allow you to take the CS 173 Proficiency Exam after taking CS 374 (or a more advanced theoretical CS course).

The website for the [Spring 2025](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs173/sp2025/ALL-lectures/) course has a current set of skills lists, lecture notes, and videos. See its resources tab for where to find practice materials.

The exam will include some free-response questions (e.g. proofs) which are manually graded, so it will take a few days for results to be available.  A couple weeks before the exam, details will be posted here about how to enroll for the exam on Prairielearn and how to access a "Sandbox"  
assessment with notes on how to format your free-response work (LaTeX is not required).
