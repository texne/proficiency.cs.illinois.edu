**CS 105's proficiency exam is in Python. Also, we provide practice exams!**
Anyone familiar with Python should be able to do well on 105's proficiency exam. We definitely encourage contacting the term's instructor early in order to arrange access to practice exam generators for the proficiency exam. Students can generate as many practice exams as they wish. The exam, as well as the practice exams, use the PrairieLearn platform. One of the additional benefits of practice exams is getting used to the way the platform operates.
