To join the proficiency course on PrairieLearn, log in to [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.org/) using your Illinois login.
Then join the
[CS 124: Introduction to Computer Science I, Proficiency Exam](https://prairielearn.org/pl/course_instance/12498/) course.

**After you join the PrairieLearn course there is no registration process for the CS 124 proficiency exam.**
<!--- -->
Simply join the Zoom call at the beginning of one of the listed times and you
will be able to access the exam while you are on the proctoring call.

<!---
Note that there are two versions of the CS 125 proficiency exam: one with
programming questions and code reading questions in Java
and a second with them in C++.
<!---
Both exams will be given online with proctoring performed over Zoom.
<!---
**If you are a CS major and want to continue to CS 128 you must take the
proficiency exam in Java.**
<!--- -->
**The CS 124 proficiency exam is given in Java.**
<!--- -->
CS 128 assumes that incoming students are familiar with Java, and students that
are not have struggled.
<!--- -->
If you are proficient in another programming language and strong enough to start
in CS 128, you should not have trouble learning Java to pass the
proficiency exam.

<!---
Other students may take the proficiency exam in either Java or C++ depending on
which language you are more familiar with.
<!---
**However, you may still not take both in the same semester.**
-->

<!--
Also note that ECE students *must* take
[ECE 220](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE220)
before taking CS 173 and CS 225.
**ECE students may not take the CS 125 proficiency exam and then continue to CS
173.**
