* **Format**: computer-based
<!--- -->
* **Length**: 3 hours
<!--- -->
* **Location**: Online, proctored via Zoom during the scheduled time windows
<!--- -->
* **Date and Time**:
  * 1&ndash;4PM Monday August 16th
  * 8&ndash;11AM Tuesday August 17th

<!--- -->

<!--- -->
* **More Information**: is available on the [CS 125 website](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/proficiency/).
<!--- -->
Note that the CS 124 proficiency exam will be similar in format to the CS 125
proficiency exam.
<!--- -->
So you can use the CS 125 proficiency materials to prepare until we have CS 124
materials available.

<!---
Note that there are two versions of the CS 125 proficiency exam: one with
programming questions and code reading questions in Java
and a second with them in C++.
<!---
Both exams will be given online with proctoring performed over Zoom.
<!---
**If you are a CS major and want to continue to CS 128 you must take the
proficiency exam in Java.**
<!--- -->
**The CS 124 proficiency exam is given in Java.**
<!--- -->
CS 128 assumes that incoming students are familiar with Java, and students that
are not have struggled.
<!--- -->
If you are proficient in another programming language and strong enough to start
in CS 128, you should not have trouble learning enough Java to pass the
proficiency exam.

<!---
Other students may take the proficiency exam in either Java or C++ depending on
which language you are more familiar with.
<!---
**However, you may still not take both in the same semester.**
-->

<!--
Also note that ECE students *must* take
[ECE 220](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE220)
before taking CS 173 and CS 225.
**ECE students may not take the CS 125 proficiency exam and then continue to CS
173.**
