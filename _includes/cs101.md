**CS 101's proficiency exam is in Python. We provide a practice exam generator for use studying/preparing and as an interactive "topic list" for the proficiency exam.**

CS 101's proficiency exam requires two things: familiarity with Python and familiarity with some key Python libraries (sympy, numpy, matplotlib, pandas). The practice proficiency exam generator matches 1-to-1 topic wise with the proficiency exam itself. The questions allow for multiple attempts with a point penalty for wrong answers after the second attempt. The practice proficiency and proficiency both provide a Jupyter notebook environment so students can debug and test their Python code *before* submitting questions to be graded.
